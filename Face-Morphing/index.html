        <h1>Face Morphing</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Here, we will be investigating morphing: transforming one image into another. 
            All morphs boil down to warping and cross-dissolving images, tools which let us 
            compute and output a morph. We will be doing this in steps: defining correspondences, 
            computing the midway face, showing a morph sequence, calculating the "mean-face" of 
            a population, creating caricatures, and changing features of images.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p> First, we define a set of corresponding points between the two images. The 
            keypoints picked usually correspond to significant features on the face, and I picked 
            them using my own function, which used the ginput tool. Then, I calculated the midway face, 
            the average of the two faces, and then ran Delaunay Triangulation on them. Images with both the 
            points and the triangulation set on the two images are below.
        </p>

    </div>

    <section>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p> Now we reach one of the most important steps, the 
            computation of the midway face. Using the average shape and after computing the 
            inverse of the transformation matrix between each triangle in the original image with 
            the corresponding triangle in the average shape, we are able to warp the image, using 
            a polygon mask. We then cross-dissolve to get the midway face.

    </div>

    <section>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p> Now that we can warp to the mid-way shape, we can create a morph sequence 
            that shows a nice morphing between the two images below. (Reload the page to see 
            the gif if you want to see the gif again)

    <script>
        var randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
        document.getElementById('morphGif').src = "images/results/morph_sequence.gif?" + randomNum;
    </script>

    <section>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p> Now, we are going to be calculating the mean face of a population. We will be 
            looking at a data set (IMM database) of the Danish population, specifically the 37 images from the 
            initial dataset. This set consisted of 30 males and 7 females, and the mean face was 
            computed after reading in the asf and bmp files in the dataset. The asf files contained 
            the necessary keypoints needed to help with the computation of the mean face of the population. 
            Below, are a few of the images warped to the mean face. I then warped my face to the mean face and  
            then warped the mean face to my face.

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p> Here we will be working with caricatures, which is an exaggeration of features, 
            which we will be doing by warping faces to an exaggerated version of the average 
            face shape. I did this process to both my face and an image from the IMM database.

        <h3>Interesting Experiment</h3>
        <p> I decided to try an ethnicity change on my face using an "average" caucasian male 
            face. There were methods explored: only morphing shape (warping), only morphing 
            appearance (cross-dissolving), and morphing both of them.
